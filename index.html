                  The jobs our Hardware Logic Designers do are anything but routine.
                  These are the people responsible for chip layout, circuit design,
                  circuit checking, device evaluation and validation.
                  Starting with product requirements and logic diagrams,
                  they plan design projects and help address the unique needs of our customers.

                  Analog design engineers are responsible for designing electrical signals across a range of electronic equipment.
                  As an analog design engineer, you should have the basics of analog and digital fundamentals as you would be
                  providing solutions to significant problems related to your field. You will provide a specific design solution,
                   which will be further designed on computer-aided design software to test functionality, planning, placement and
                   routing, speed, latency, and debugging appropriately. The design will be fabricated; hence, you must guarantee its functionality,
                   maintenance, and updating.
